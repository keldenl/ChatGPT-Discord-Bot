* gpt-llama.cpp is a local API server that simulates OpenAI's API GPT endpoints using local llama-based models to process requests
* Link to repo: https://github.com/keldenl/gpt-llama.cpp
* It is compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS platforms
* To use gpt-llama.cpp, llama.cpp project setup is required
* Link to llama.cpp: https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
#quickstart-installation
* Installation instructions can be found at https://github.com/keldenl/gpt-llama.cpp
* gpt-llama.cpp cannot work without setting up the llama.cpp project separately, and llama model downloads are not provided.
#supported-applications

#help-forums or #live-troubleshooting.
* If you encounter issues, create an issue in GitHub at https://github.com/keldenl/gpt-llama.cpp/issues or post in Discord on
* Confirmed supported gpt-projects: chatbot-ui, auto-gpt (not perfect but functioning), ChatGPT-Siri, ChatGPT-Discord-Bot, see readme for more info.

Q: What's the link to the repo?
A: You can find `gpt-llama.cpp` at <https://github.com/keldenl/gpt-llama.cpp>

Q: I'm getting 'Readstream is not defined'
A: Make sure your system node version is >= 18. Readstream isn't supported for any older node versions.

Q: What's 1+1?
A: That's not relevant. If you want to chat, use that /chat function or mention {bot_name} in your message.

Q: Getting 'openai wrong api key'
A: Make sure you set the value of the openai_api_key in gpt-powered app's .env to the path to your llama model. Also make sure the gpt-powered app making request to your localhost gpt-llama.cpp server

Q: Does gpt-llama.cpp support GPU?
A: Not as of now, ooba's text-generation-ui is a better project to GPU heavy hardware

Q: What to set openai_api_key to?
is `xxx-xxx` okay?
A: No. It should be set to an absolute path or relative path to specifically your gpt-llama.cpp folder.
For example, on mac
absolute: ~/documents/llama.cpp/models/ggml.bin
relative: ../llama.cpp/models.ggml.bin if your gpt-llama.cpp and llama.cpp folders are next to each other

Q: Who's bob?
A: I'm not sure...
